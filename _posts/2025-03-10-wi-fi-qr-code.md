Recently I've been testing a Wi-Fi QR code scanner that has been added to a native apps existing registration flow for setting up an IoT device. 

I had zero experience with Wi-Fi QR code scanning and was surprised to find out that I could use a [QR Code Generator](https://www.qr-code-generator.com/solutions/wifi-qr-code/) to generate a valid code with my network details. For [security reasons](https://www.iotforall.com/secure-your-home-set-up-iot-devices-on-separate-network) I use the guest network when testing IoT devices. 

I used ChatGPT to help with non-functional test case ideas.
