title: "Day Zero - Starting a Blog"

## The What?
A simple blog with a software and quality focus. I want this to be a place where I share snippets of useful information (Mostly about software testing) and link out to articles I find interesting or fun. I'm not aiming for a traditional blog filled with long articles or in-depth step by step guides.

## The Why?
It seemed like a good idea, learning and sharing sparks joy.

## The How?
I settled on [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/skills/github-pages) as it seemed relatively easy to get started as I'm already fairly comfortable with Git and Markdown, it's free, and I keep full control over my content (or lack of). I instantly encountered an issue with Actions runs failing with a billing error, which was solved by going to bed and rerunning the jobs in the morning.
